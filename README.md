<h1>Hello, I'm Anthony, an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-rodr%C3%ADguez-pacheco-104728339/">Entry-Level IT Support </a>☺</h1>

**`CSIS Student`** 
 <h3>👨🏽‍💻 Anthony's Coding Journey</h3>
I've had a passion for computers since my early teens, and I built my first computer at the age of 13. Since then, my curiosity has only grown, and I've been dedicated to gaining a deeper understanding of how computers work.

I'm currently in college studying Python, and going to be studying Java, Csisco and networks during the summer and fall of 2025. I'm also working towards obtaining my CourseCareer's IT certification. My goal is to secure an entry-level IT position to further develop my skills and gain practical experience. After graduation, I plan to pursue the CompTIA Security+ certification to expand my expertise in cybersecurity.

Ultimately, my aim is to work in cybersecurity, helping to prevent malicious attacks and safeguard valuable data.
